## 🔍 Applications


### Web Crawlable LLM Context Enhancement
- **/llms.txt**: Generate a compact, web-crawlable context file (typically 10-20KB) that allows LLMs to access your personal or organizational information during web searches.
- **/llms-full.txt**: Create an expanded knowledge file (50-100KB) with comprehensive details about your work, expertise, and content that search-powered LLMs can index.
- **Web Context Sources**: Enable web search LLMs like Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to discover and reference your structured information during user queries.

### RAG Applications

## 🌲 Algorithm

The knowledge base builder uses a streamlined three-step approach for efficient processing:

1. **Text Extraction**
   - All documents are processed concurrently into plain text files
   - Uses a semaphore to limit concurrent processing
   - Each document is converted into a clean text format
   - Optimized for parallel processing with controlled concurrency

2. **Text Merging**
   - All extracted text files are merged into a single text file
   - Maintains document separation and structure
   - No LLM calls during this phase
   - Very efficient memory usage

3. **LLM Processing**
   - The merged text file is processed by the LLM in a single operation
   - LLM creates a well-structured, organized knowledge base
   - Only one LLM call for the entire process
   - Optimized for context window usage

This approach provides several advantages:
- Minimal LLM calls (just one for the entire process)
- Better parallelization of text extraction
- More predictable memory usage
- Significantly faster overall processing time
- Lower API costs due to reduced LLM usage

---

## ⚡ Concurrency Model

The knowledge base builder implements a multi-layer concurrency model to maximize performance while maintaining stability:

### 1. File Processing Concurrency
```python
# Multiple files processed simultaneously
tasks = [process_file_async(file) for file in files]
await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```
- Enables parallel processing of multiple files
- Each file type (PDF, DOCX, web page, etc.) is processed independently
- Significantly reduces total processing time for multiple files

### 2. CPU-Bound Operations
```python
# CPU-intensive operations run in separate threads
path = await asyncio.to_thread(processor.download, url)
text = await asyncio.to_thread(processor.extract_text, path)
```
- Downloads and text extraction run in separate threads
- Prevents blocking the event loop during I/O operations
- Optimizes CPU utilization across cores

### 3. LLM Processing Concurrency
```python
# Controlled concurrent LLM API calls
async with self._sem:
    result = await self.llm_client.run_async(prompt)
```
- Uses a semaphore to limit concurrent LLM API calls
- Prevents overwhelming the LLM API
- Helps stay within API rate limits
- Default concurrency limit: 8 simultaneous requests

### 4. Final KB Merging
```python
# Concurrent preprocessing followed by single merge
tasks = [preprocess_text_async(text) for text in texts]
preprocessed_kbs = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
final_kb = await merge_all_kbs(preprocessed_kbs)
```
- Preprocesses all documents concurrently
- Merges them into a final knowledge base

### Performance Considerations
- **Resource Management**: CPU-bound operations don't block the event loop
- **Rate Limiting**: LLM API calls are properly throttled
- **Scalability**: System can handle many files without performance degradation
- **Constraints**:
  - LLM concurrency limit (default: 8)
  - System resources (CPU, memory, network)
  - LLM API rate limits

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

### Memory Usage
- **Document Processing**: Each document is loaded into memory during processing
- **LLM Context Windows**: Different models have different context window limits:
  - Gemini: 1M tokens
- **Merge Operations**: Final merge operation requires all preprocessed KBs in memory
- **Recommendation**: Monitor memory usage when processing large documents or many files

### Processing Time
- **I/O Operations**: Each file requires multiple I/O operations:
  - Downloading/reading the file
  - Text extraction
- **LLM Latency**: Each document requires at least one LLM call:
  - One call per document for preprocessing
  - One final call for merging

### Rate Limits
- **LLM API Limits**: Each provider has different rate limits
- **GitHub API**: low when unauthenticated
- **Web Scraping**: Some websites may block rapid requests
